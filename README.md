	- Fixed massive FPS drop from halos being rendered in a Think hook instead of a PreDrawHalos hook.
	- Fixed materials and color saving when duping stacked props.
	- Fixed incorrect stack angles when trying to create a stack on an existing stack.
	
### Tweaks:
	- Added convenience functions to retrieve the client convars.
	- Added option to enable/disable automatically applying materials to the stacked props.
	- Added option to enable/disable automatically applying colors to the stacked props.
	- Added option to enable/disable automatically applying physical properties (gravity, physics material, weight) to the stacked props.
	- Added support for props with multiple skins.
	- Added support for external prop protections/anti-spam addons with the StackerEntity hook.
	- Modified NoCollide to actually no-collide each stacker prop with every other prop in the stack.
	
	- Added console variables for server operators to limit various parts of stacker.

	- Added console commands for server admins to control the console variables that limit stacker.
